9 TEST CASES
9.1 INTERACTION WITH ENVIRONMENT VIA HEAD MOTION
The user can interact with the virtual environment through movements of their head. As a test case, 
The beginning position is referred to as a frontal anatomical correct stationary position
The user should move their head 90 degrees to the right 
Return to the frontal anatomical correct stationary position
The user should move their head 90 degrees to the left 
Return to the frontal anatomical correct stationary position
The user should move their head up 90 degrees and down 90 degrees to view all possible lines-of-sight.
9.2 INTERACTION WITH ENVIRONMENT VIA HAND MOTION
The user can use the Oculus Touch Controllers to interact with Iteration 1’s environment demo objects. The following test cases was developed with the following demo objects: a red cube, a blue cube, and a yellow cube. The test case to test the hand’s ability and limitations in motion are as follows:
Using both virtual hands (both motion controllers) lift the blue cube off the table (lift by placing both hands on opposite sides) 
Place the cube on top of the yellow cube
Repeat by placing the red cube on top of the blue cube.
Launch the cubes off the table by pushing the cubes off the table with either of the virtual hands
